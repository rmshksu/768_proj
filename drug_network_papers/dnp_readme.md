Identifying and Informing Strategies for Disrupting Drug Distribution Networks: An Application to Opiate Flows in Pennsylvania

---

- Network analysis

  - ***It's a dense paper, I'm doing my best this late in the day. I may say some fs ong.***
 
  - Network of opiod distribution, simulated based off of relevant data
 
  - They use exponential random graph models, not extensively familiar (I should be so thats sad)
 
  - Major goal is to represent an evolving social network
 
- Drug connection distributions according to their study (Pennsylvania isn't that off from Kansas)

  - heroin only (43.5%)
  
  - other drugs only (38.1%)
  
  - prescription opioids only (7.3%)
  
  - fentanyl only (1.6%)
 
- Their analysis showed a concentration of high degree nodes/vertices at the specific drug category level with very few "multiple hats" drug dealers

- There's something to be said about treating the possible permutations of connections across a network of unobserved connections as a way to generate some causal results. It's probably been done before but it's worth digging into. (OPEN FOR UPDATE PLEASE HOLD ME ACCOUNTABLE)

- Possibility for a framework of primary prevention as an S-I-A-S-R model: an S-I-S model where members of the population can die (R==Removed) or become educated and aware of the drug/overdose epidemic (A==Aware). It's an interesting concept when you consider that members of the A-Aware group would be able to spread awareness and provide community support, in turn "spreading" their affect to neighboring nodes
 
- Slight complication comes into play with the idea of race affecting probability of interaction

  - It's intuitive when you say it out loud but we might consider that either as an incorporation or a statement of missing assumption
 
- They use some drug arrest data to bolster their analysis, gonna look into RCPD/KHWP to see if they have the same data

Incorporating space and time into random forest models for analyzing geospatial patterns of drug-related crime incidents in a major U.S. metropolitan area

---

- Variable consideration

  - Paper gives us a lot in terms of possible predictor variables to consider
 
  - Space
 
  - Time
 
  - Community membership
 
  - Cultural Demographic
 
  - Socio-economic status
 
  - Typical drug of choice
 
- Honestly from skimming it's not much beyond that

- This Xia person wrote a whole lot on this topic (iirc I downloaded their entire dissertation without realizing it) but isn't providing much to our specific study beyond places we can look for data (public data bases held by counties/state orgs) and what variables may be of importance

- Referencable if we use their results to justify initial variable selection, but for now not certain it'll make the final cut

Towards spatially disaggregated cocaine supply chain modeling

---

- So much to say tbh but it's a concise summary

- This guy Magliocca did a few more papers like this I'm just trying to hunt them down

- This is basically what we want to look at emulating

- Legal supply chains -> Illegal supply chains

  - They used knowledge of existing legal supply chains to make inference about how illegal drug trafficking should be functioning
 
- It's cocaine, but we can draw a lot of similarities

- Economic focus

  - This paper went hard on the idea that drug supply is focused on economics
 
  - Which like... duh, yeah, yes, of course
 
  - But looking at it from the perspective of "as the market deems one location more profitable, supply is reduced/removed from other locations previously deemed viable"
 
  - So popularity of the drugs moving in is a useful variable and ?potentially? a strong focus if we go for it
 
- I'm trying to hunt down all the data he's been using too but it's a little annoying to find (he took down his personal website and that's where he housed all of the public data links)

Coupling agent-based simulation and spatial optimization models to underﬆand spatially complex and co-evolutionary behavior of cocaine traﬃcking networks and counterdrug interdiction

---

- I need to dive deeper into this one, this needs a stronger vocabulary to handle

- TL;DR - They used some agent based models (simulations). They found that as counter drug tactics are used the narcos respond in kind by evolving their methods for trafficking

  - Idk that feels intuitive, that's the definition of an arms race
 
  - But w/e we needed results/proof/verification that the statement made sense
 
- ELI5: If you plug a point on an old pipe thats burst, it tends to just burst in a new location

- Evidently, a lot of these previous analyses looked at the counterdrug actions and trafficking movements as constant/fixed variables instead of treating them as dynamic/random variables

  - This could help us inform our construction of the process model better? Agent-based modeling is a little extreme though. We'd have to make that our primary goal if we really wanted to jump to that. Open to thoughts:
 
| Do we consider Agent-Based Modeling? | Y/N (ELI) | Y/N (STEPHEN) | 

- I did snag the data for this (I think? It had the authors name on it so I think.)
