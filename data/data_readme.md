Ya honestly no clue. I barely opened it and looked around. 10/10 needs extra eyes. Also that paper included DEFINITELY has a lot of the needed context but it's late and I'm just gonna program for the rest of the night until I fall asleep on the couch again.

From what I can tell it could either be super useful data or just fluff to my GitHub commit history.

I think this Excel file can be handy in our work in terms of the number of deaths due to drug overdose for each state. Although a special category for Fentanyl is not indicated, it can be considered in the category of synthetic opioids, and from all I have read about Fentanyl, I can categorically say that it is the main drug in this class group.
