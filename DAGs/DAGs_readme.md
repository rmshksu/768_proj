DAGs_1

GDP (Gross Domestic Product) likely influences PCPI (per capita personal income), TAX (State Gov. Tax Collections), and possibly PBD (Percentage Bachelors Degree or Higher) (via investment in public services).
Per Capita Personal Income can influence HOR (homeownership rate) (higher income = more likely to own homes) and PBD (affordability/access).
PBD can influence HOR (via better employment) and drug use behaviors, possibly acting as a protective factor against overdose.
Population size may correlate with TAX (more people = more tax revenue) and death counts (as a scale effect).
Year should influence most variables due to temporal trends (e.g., economic growth, public health policy, fentanyl availability).
Each variable ultimately contributes directly or indirectly to predicting overdose deaths.

DAGs_2

GDP directly affects HOR, TAX, and fentanyl overdose deaths.
HOR and TAX also directly influence fentanyl overdose death.

DAGs_3

State influences GDP, HOR, TAX, and directly deaths (representing geographic variation).
Year influences GDP, HOR, TAX, and deaths (capturing temporal trends).
GDP directly affects HOR, TAX, and fentanyl overdose deaths.
HOR and TAX also directly influence fentanyl overdose death.

Comment

I think I prefer DAGs_3 because it talks about the three main predictors while taking into account spatial (state) and temporal (time) variables. However, we can also refine the DAG(s) to come up with a better one that can be used for the project.
