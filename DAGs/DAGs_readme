GDP (Gross Domestic Product) likely influences per capita personal income, tax collections, and possibly education levels (via investment in public services).
Per Capita Personal Income can influence homeownership rate (higher income = more likely to own homes) and education levels (affordability/access).
Education Level can influence homeownership (via better employment) and drug use behaviors, possibly acting as a protective factor against overdose.
Population size may correlate with tax collections (more people = more tax revenue) and death counts (as a scale effect).
Year should influence most variables due to temporal trends (e.g., economic growth, public health policy, fentanyl availability).
Each variable ultimately contributes directly or indirectly to predicting overdose deaths.

DAGs_2:
GDP directly affects HOR, TAX, and fentanyl overdose deaths.
HOR and TAX also directly influence fentanyl overdose death.

DAGs_3:
State influences: GDP, HOR, TAX, and directly deaths (representing geographic variation).
Year influences: GDP, HOR, TAX, and deaths (capturing temporal trends).
GDP directly affects HOR, TAX, and fentanyl overdose deaths.
HOR and TAX also directly influence fentanyl overdose death.
