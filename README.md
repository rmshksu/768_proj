# 768_proj
Final project for STAT 768 at KSU, Applied Bayesian Modeling and Prediction

Data we need N_drugs -> # of deaths and also N_users -> # of users
We need an estimate of the number of users seeking drugs in Kansas (need sources for number of users seeking drugs in Kansas)

[z|y] =[y] 

[y|N_i,P_i] ~ Binom(N_i, P_i) 

[N_i| lambda ] ~ Pois(lambda)

[P_i|a,b] ~ Beta(a,B) 



We can estimate lambda from the data or assume it

Results of the model -> 

RESEARCH GOAL: Inform primary prevention practices for Fentanyl overdose

RESEARCH QUESTION: 

PRIMARY

1. What are the primary spatial sources for Fentanyl overdose (Within the study area of Kansas)?

2. What is the most effecient practice for reduction of Fentanyl overdose (Within the study area of Kansas)?

SECONDARY

1. How much of drug overdose can be linked to Fentanyl?

2. How do our results change as our study area expands?
