RESEARCH GOAL: Inform primary prevention practices for Fentanyl overdose

RESEARCH QUESTION: 

PRIMARY

1. What are the primary spatial sources for Fentanyl overdose (Within the study area of Kansas)?

2. What is the most effecient practice for reduction of Fentanyl overdose (Within the study area of Kansas)?

SECONDARY

1. How much of drug overdose can be linked to Fentanyl?

2. How do our results change as our study area expands?
